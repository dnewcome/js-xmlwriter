Split things up into multiple layers:
- Literal writing
- tracking whitespace and formatting (formatting is part of the base writer. I think it
probably belongs there.)

x tracking tag stack for auto-close of tags
x tracking namespaces

- write as recursive 'builder'?
- write as eventemitter?
- state machine?
- write functional instead of building up xml string as side effect
- enable/disable pretty print 

- automatic namespace handling? currently we just handle namespaces and prefixes
manually by appending prefix to tag name and putting xmlns declarations in as 
attributes.

I decided not to track closing tags for auto-close. I also did not track namespace
scopes for automatic handling of prefixes and URIs. This may be added at some point
or I may do a wrapper around this basic writer that adds that logic.
